# Project Discussion Feature

The Project Discussion feature enhances the technical interview by enabling in-depth conversations about the candidate's past projects.

## How It Works

1. **Resume Upload:** When a candidate uploads their resume, the system automatically extracts:
   - Project information and titles
   - Technologies used in those projects
   - Skills mentioned throughout the resume

2. **Project Selection:**
   - The AI interviewer identifies projects from the resume
   - The candidate is asked which project they would like to discuss in detail
   - The interviewer focuses the technical conversation on that specific project

3. **In-Depth Technical Discussion:**
   - The AI asks detailed technical questions about architecture, design decisions, challenges, and implementation details
   - Follow-up questions probe the candidate's understanding of their technical choices
   - The discussion assesses the candidate's problem-solving approach and technical depth

4. **Multiple Project Coverage:**
   - The interviewer may suggest discussing a second project if needed
   - This helps form a more complete picture of the candidate's experience
   - The interview covers a maximum of 2 projects to ensure a thorough but efficient conversation

## Benefits

1. **Personalized Experience:** Each interview is tailored to the candidate's specific background and projects
2. **Comfort Zone Starting Point:** Discussing familiar projects helps candidates feel more comfortable initially
3. **Authentic Assessment:** Candidates can demonstrate deeper knowledge when discussing work they've actually done
4. **Technical Depth:** The interviewer asks progressively more technical questions to assess true understanding
